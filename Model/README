IDA merge strategy

1. Adaptive channel merge      : normal addition, keep channels of each stage.
2. Fixed channel merge         : normal addition, keep same channels(eg.32 in the original paper) for each stage.
3. Gated adaptive channel merge: gated normal addition, keep channels of each stage.
4. Gated fixed channel merge   : gated normal addition, keep same channels(eg.32 in the original paper) for each stage.
